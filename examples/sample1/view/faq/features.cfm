<h2>What are some of LightFront's features?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Basic Front Controller:</strong> LightFront gives you the basics of a front controller. It gives you what you need, and whatever else might want, you can build onto.</li>
	<li><strong>Small:</strong> It's so small and lightweight, calling it a &quot;framework&quot; at all may be a bit of a misnomer. It's so small, in fact, that you have to look for it to know it's even there. LightFront consists of a single CFC that's less than 250 lines of code (212 in the current release), along with config settings in your Application.cfc.</li>
	<li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> There are only three functions to learn as part of the framework. That's small enough that anyone with novice level ColdFusion skills can use. You can learn how to use LightFront in 30 minutes or less.</li>
	<li>More later...</li>
