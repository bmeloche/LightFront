<h2>Are views an example of conventions?</h2>
<p>Yes and no. When using views as actions, you're using a convention. There was no controller matching that class, but there was a view folder matching the class and a view file matching the method, so LightFront used that view as the action.</p>
<p>You are also using a convention by expecting all of the views to be placed in a &quot;view&quot; folder.</p>
<p>However, if you're not using views as an action, and aside from the location, LightFront doesn't apply conventions to views.</p>
