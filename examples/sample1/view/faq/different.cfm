<h2>How is LightFront different than other MVC frameworks?<h2>
<p>LightFront is similar to several of the other frameworks, in many ways. However, it does set its own path, as it does things in a few unique ways.</p>
<h3>It's Small... Very Small</h3>
<p>The main file, lightfront.cfc, is just a little more than 200 lines of code. Unlike any other ColdFusion framework, it's designed to be simple. It's a controller framework. It delivers your views, but does not care about your model - that's up to you. LightFront allows so to use three simple functions which, with some good programming practices, allows you to build whatever it is you need your controller to do.</p>
<p>It's so small... it's self-documenting. If you've ever looked at the bigger MVC frameworks, you'd know that there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes, and those frameworks tend to be harder to follow, harder to learn, and also do a lot behind the scenes. LightFront is so small and simple, you should be able to read the Application.cfc and lightfront.cfc and the samples and understand what it's trying to do.</p>
<p>Ironically, LightFront is most like another recent lightweight MVC framework called <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/">FW/1</a>.
