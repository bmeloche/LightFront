<h2>What about LightFront and ORM, like Reactor, Transfer, DataMgr, DataFaucet and ColdFusion 9's Hibernate functionality?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion 9's</a> new ORM functionality with Hibernate on the back end promises to revolutionize how CF handles data. This new functionality will work whether you develop using object-oriented design or your apps are procedural-based.</p>
<p>If you are on ColdFusion 8, <a href="http://www.openbluedragon.org/">Open BlueDragon</a> or <a href="http://www.getrailo.org/">Railo.</a>, you can instead use <a href="http://www.reactorframework.org">Reactor</a>, <a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com">Transfer</a>, <a href="http://datamgr.riaforge.org/">DataMgr</a> or <a href="http://datafaucet.riaforge.org/">DataFaucet</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, LightFront is a front controller-based framework. Because these ORM frameworks and ColdFusion 9 w/Hibernate deals with your model, LightFront doesn't care whether you use ORM or not.</p>
<p>That said, if you are using LightFront, you are strongly encouraged to put your data CFCs in a model structure whether you use an ORM or not. LightFront doesn't care, though... so we won't cover the possibilities in any detail.</p>
