<h2>I don't like all of my pages going through index.cfm or whatever I've called the default cfm page. Can I still use LightFront?</h2>
<p>Yes, but... why? It is possible, but you will miss some functionality, and that use of LightFront is not supported or encouraged.</p>
<p>If a user stays to a hub, it's good. If you bounce around, you will have additional complexity in your application.</p>
